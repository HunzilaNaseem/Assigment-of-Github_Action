## 🛠️ What it does

There are two GitHub Actions workflows in this project:

1. **Run Script Workflow** (`run-script.yml`)  
   - Triggered on `push` to the `main` branch  
   - It checks out the code and runs `main.sh`  

2. **Lint & Test Workflow** (`test and lint.yml`)  
   - Triggered on `push` (and possibly `pull_request`) to `main`  
   - Installs dependencies  
   - Runs `npm run lint`  
   - Runs `npm test`
